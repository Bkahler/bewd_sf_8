#BEWD - Collections, Loops & APIs

###Cheat Sheet

####Array of Hashes

```ruby
super_heros =[{ hero: 'Batman', secret_identity: 'Bruce Wayne'}, {hero: 'Superman', secret_identity: 'Clark Kent'}, {hero: 'Spiderman', secret_identity: 'Peter Parker'}]
```


####.each & .map

```ruby
super_heros.map do |super_hero| 
	puts "#{super_hero[:hero]} is #{super_hero[:secret_identity]}"
end
```
	
```ruby
super_heros.each do |super_hero| 
	puts "#{super_hero[:hero]} is #{super_hero[:secret_identity]}"
end
```

*	.each returns the original array. 
*	Map returns a new array with the results you added.

# Homework

## Public APIs

#### Beginner

* [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/.json) (remember the ".json" at the end!) - try listing front page items and their upvotes and links in text form
* [JSON Placeholder](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) - Useful fake data apis for testing. (Look at the list of endpoints under "Resources" headline)
* [Github Rails API](https://api.github.com/users/rails/repos) - This is a list of all of the repositories in the Rails organization. What interesting things can you find?

#### Advanced 

* [Census Data](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html) (many options here)
* [Colorado Trademarks](https://data.colorado.gov/Business/Colorado-Trademarks/d3m2-b6we) Click "Export" and find JSON for the data. Many options to play with here.
